# Which-king-are-you-
Game inspired by the game "Reigns".

AS a kingdom ruler, every day you face a dillema. 
Choose wisely - every decision will affect one of more of your atributes. 
When even one of them reaches zero, the game ends and your score gets added to the hall of fame.
You can view your decisions afterwards and see what you did wrong.

Second project for object oriented programing course.
